Here are the instructions for the **Local Verification** step.

We are going to verify that the bot can successfully **connect to your email** and **extract data using Gemini** before we worry about the web browser automation.

### Step 1: Create your `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (`route_runner/.env`) and paste the following. **Replace the values with your real credentials.**

```bash
# route_runner/.env

# Your Gmail address
EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"

# Your Gmail App Password (NOT your normal password)
# Generate here: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
EMAIL_PASS="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"

# Your Gemini API Key
# Get it here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_KEY="AIzaSy..."

# Email to receive the success/error report
NOTIFY_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run this in your terminal to ensure you have the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### Step 3: Send a Test Email
1.  Open your email client.
2.  Compose a new email to yourself (`EMAIL_USER`).
3.  **Subject:** `Invoice` (Case sensitive!).
4.  **Attachment:** Attach a sample PDF invoice.
5.  **Send it** and leave it **Unread**.

### Step 4: Run the Bot
Execute the script:

```bash
# This command loads the .env variables automatically if you use a tool like 'dotenv',
# but since we are using standard os.environ, we can run it like this:
export $(cat .env | xargs) && python main.py
```
*(If the export command is too complex or fails on your shell, you can manually export the variables or just tell me, and I can add `python-dotenv` to the project to make it automatic).*

**What should happen:**
1.  The script will print "Connecting to IMAP...".
2.  It should find your unread email.
3.  It should print "Extracted: BOL [Number]..." showing the data Gemini found.
4.  It will try to "Upload" (which is currently just a mock print statement).
5.  You should receive a summary report email.
